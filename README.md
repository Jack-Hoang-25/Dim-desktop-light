This is my first python script. 

I usually don't put my video on fullscreen so it can be a bit blinding for website with bright background. 
This script basically will dim the white background outside your videoplayer. Currently I used time.sleep()
to wait between running the script and reforcusing the video player windows, but hopefully in the future I
figure out how to make this a real program with buttons and always on top.
