This is my first python project. 

I usually don't put my video on fullscreen so it can be a bit blinding for website with bright background. 
This program basically will dim the white background outside your videoplayer after you select the two corner
of the your video player. 

Usage:

1. Run the .exe file or start_button.py to initialize the program.
2. Re-focus your video player 
3. Click the start button then click on the top-left and bottom-right corner of your video player
4. Watch your video
5. Click on the overlay to quit
