This is my first python script. 

I usually don't put my video on fullscreen so it can be a bit blinding for website with bright background. 
This script basically will dim the white background outside your videoplayer. Currently I used time.sleep()
to wait between running the script and reforcusing the video player windows, but hopefully in the future I
figure out how to make this a real program with buttons and always on top. 

Useage:

Run the script then left click to set the top left of the video player then left click again to set the 
bottom right of the video player. Afterward, click anywhere on the blackoverlay to exit.
